Frontend
- javascript
- react because it's an awesome frontend framework (Facebook)
- material ui for pretty components (Google)
- ~~axios to make http requests to backend's api, better than just `fetch`~~ looks like `fetch` is part of node.js now, maybe use that instead?


Backend
- go
- pgx for postgres driver, seems to be most used
- postgres
  - extremely popular relational database that's withstood the test of time


Build stuff
- docker for front and backends
- docker compose to package it all up, and run postgres image
